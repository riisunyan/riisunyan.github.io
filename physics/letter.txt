Dear Students,
This year, our Slemish College Rocket Club has once again demonstrated skill and dedication in the UKROC Northern Ireland competition. As a result, our winning team, Ultimate Scramble, will be heading to Birmingham to compete in the UK nationals! This is an incredible opportunity to showcase our talent on a national stage.
To make this possible, we are seeking sponsorships to help cover costs for travel and additional rocket supplies. Additionally, securing sponsorships this year could set the foundation for future funding, allowing us to continue competing at higher levels in the years to come.
If you or your family know of any local businesses willing to support our journey, please reach out. Every contribution helps bring us closer to our goal!
Thank you for your support, Slemish College Rocket Club

Dear [Company Name],
I am writing on behalf of the Slemish College Rocket Club, a dedicated team of students competing in the UK Youth Rocketry Challenge (UKROC). Each year, we participate in the Northern Ireland regional competition, where the winner progresses to the UK national finals. The top three teams at the national level then advance to represent the UK on an international stage.
This year, our team has won the Northern Ireland competition and will be traveling to Birmingham to compete against the best teams in the UK. To ensure we can compete at our best, we are seeking sponsorships to help cover travel, materials, and entry costs.
By sponsoring us, your company would gain:
Positive exposure within our school and the wider community.
Recognition on our social media, (school website if it gets updated?????)  and event materials.
(I probably need more points for this)
We would be delighted to discuss potential sponsorship arrangements and how we can acknowledge your support. Thank you for considering this opportunity to invest in young talent and innovation.
Best regards,
[Your Name]
Slemish College Rocket Club
